# Tic-Tac-Toe-multiplayer
simple tictactoe in python without GUI(runs in the terminal).
this is just for learning about sockets and networking

this only works on two separate computers if they are on the same local network

to start the program:

main.py is the host - at the bottom of the file there is a function game.host_game("local host")
instead of local host put in your local ip address

main2.py is the client - at the bottom of the file there is a function connect_to_game("local host")
instead of local host put in the hosts local ip address
